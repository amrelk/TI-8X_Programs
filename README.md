# TI-8X_Programs
This is an assortment of programs for the TI 83/84 series calculators. All the programs will be in in .8xp format (Unless that won't be editable through github, if so I will provide them in .txt also.)


#Licensing
This is provided under an MIT license, but please don't use these to cheat on math tests. It's really horrible that I have to say this. People should be more honest. But I do.
